part 8:
ls: list files and dirs
ls options:
      -l -> list files and dirs

bin and sbin directory is where standard command of linux are located.
bin commands is on every linux. but sbin commands is added by that specific distro.
dev dir is for devices
etc dir is for configuration files.
proc dir is for running processes
home dir is home for non root users

in linux everything is file. even dirs and processes.
file [path] -> shows file type from its content (not by its extension!)

paste: press mouse middle button or ctrl+shift+v


part 10:
using / you can search for a keyword in less result. to go next search result press n and shift n or just b for go back.
cat prints a file on screen. but less is like a app for viewing a file and search in it.
tac prints a file in reversed lines.
head and tail is like cat but prints 10 first and last lines of files.
tail -f -> follows changes to the file and shows them.

part 11:
regex usages:
rm -fr * -> remove anything from current dir
ls /etc/*li* -> lists anything containing li in their name from /etc/ dir
ls /etc/*conf -> lists anything ending with conf in their name from /etc/ dir
      ? -> any character but not empty
      {1..100}
      {a..z} -> touch {a..z}.txt
cut -> when u have a file containing lines with patterns like a table u can split each column with it

      one usefull option of cut is -d:
            cut -d [delimiter] -f[column number] [file]

      for example if this is our file:
            1/2/3
            4/5/6
            7/8/9
      cut -d / -f2 a.txt
      will return:
            2
            5
            8
      and cut -d / -f2- a.txt
      will return:
            2/3
            5/6
            8/9
grep is better than cut!
