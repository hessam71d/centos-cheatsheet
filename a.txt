cat prints a file on screen. but less is like a app for viewing a file and search in it.
tac prints a file in reversed lines.
head and tail is like cat but prints 10 first and last lines of files.
tail -f -> follows changes to the file and shows them.

part 11:
regex usages:
rm -fr * -> remove anything from current dir
ls /etc/*li* -> lists anything containing li in their name from /etc/ dir
ls /etc/*conf -> lists anything ending with conf in their name from /etc/ dir
      ? -> any character but not empty
      {1..100}
      {a..z} -> touch {a..z}.txt
cut -> when u have a file containing lines with patterns like a table u can split each column with it

      one usefull option of cut is -d:
            cut -d [delimiter] -f[column number] [file]

      for example if this is our file:
            1/2/3
            4/5/6
            7/8/9
      cut -d / -f2 a.txt
      will return:
            2
            5
            8
      and cut -d / -f2- a.txt
      will return:
            2/3
            5/6
            8/9
grep is better than cut!
